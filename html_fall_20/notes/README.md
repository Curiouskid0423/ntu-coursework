## Course Notes

- This semester **Theory of Generalization** is not covered in the official curriulum. Review the videos ([Lec22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUFqB5Z3YHQ&list=PLXVfgk9fNX2I7tB6oIINGBmW50rrmFTqf&index=22) - [Lec25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUFqB5Z3YHQ&list=PLXVfgk9fNX2I7tB6oIINGBmW50rrmFTqf&index=22)) later to learn more about the analysis on how breakpoints keep learning time in a polynomial scale, as opposed to exponential or NP. Especially the **VC bound** proof.
